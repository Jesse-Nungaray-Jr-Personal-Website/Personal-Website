# Personal Website

I am building a website that describes my personal brand, and it will be divided into three different web pages. Page one will show three words that best describe my personal brand, with a good quote that I believe fits at the moment. The second page will get more into detail about me, Jesse Nungaray Jr. The last page will display projects in my life that got me to where I am now writing this Personal Website project. See you there!
